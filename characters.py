        In this method, self attempts to attack the enemy (another Character object) .  

        First, the method uses self's and enemy's dexterity property to randomly determine if the attack lands.
        Exactly how this is implemented is up to you, but it should generally adhere to these rules:
        1) If the dexterity of self is higher than that of enemy, the probability increases.
        2) If the dexterity of self is lower than that of enemy, the probability decreases.

        If the attack lands, determine the amount of damage to be dealt to enemy. 
        It should be a random number between 0 and self's strength property.
        The enemy's hit points should then be reduced by that amount.
        
        Finally, the method should RETURN the result of the attack to the user.

        NEW: Instead of printing the result of the attack, the result is returned as a string.
