            This method does the following:
            1) Calls the character.attack method for both the player and (if still alive) the computer.
            2) Updates the labels on the top right with the results of the attacks.
            3) Determines if there was a victor, and if so display that info 
            4) If there is a victor, remove the Attack button.  Create an Exit button to replace it.  

            To remove a widget, use the destroy() method. For example:
    
                self.button.destroy()   
        '''        
        #
        # TO DO

        ''' This method is called when the Exit button is clicked. 
            It passes control back to the callback method. '''
